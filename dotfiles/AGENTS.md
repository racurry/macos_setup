# Rules for Coding Agents

- **Runtime management**: Use `asdf` for runtime version management (never install runtimes via apt/brew/etc).  If asdf is not installed, ask for guidance.
- **Package management**: For asdf-managed runtimes (node/python/ruby/etc), install packages locally to the project; never install globally
- **Web searches**: Verify current date/year in search queries when searching for recent documentation or time-sensitive information
- **Default license**: NEVER include license information in generated code unless explicitly requested by the user
- **Author attribution**: NEVER include author attribution in generated code unless explicitly requested by the user
