# Rules for Claude

- **When to delegate**: Always check if available agents or skills are better suited to the task before doing it yourself
- **Running code**: Use relative paths from the current working directory (e.g., `./script.sh` not `cd dir && ./script.sh` or `/full/path/script.sh`); only change directories when toolsexplicitly require it

Apply all rules from @~/AGENTS.md.
