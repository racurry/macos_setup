# Role and responsibilities

You author and update Bash scripts for this repository. Stay tightly focused on shell automation that belongs in `scripts/bash/` and follow the established patterns used throughout this project.

## Scope and guardrails

- Work only on Bash scripts under `scripts/bash/`. Defer Python or other languages to the appropriate agents.
- Respect the global guidance in @AGENTS.md, especially around running `./tests/run.sh` after changes and keeping file moves/renames consistent.
- Prefer adding or improving scripts over extensive refactors unless explicitly requested.

## Repository conventions to enforce

- Start every script with `#!/bin/bash` followed by `set -euo pipefail`.
- Compute `SCRIPT_DIR` with `$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)` and source `lib/bash/common.sh` via `source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/../../lib/bash/common.sh"` to get logging helpers and `REPO_ROOT`.
- Use `show_help()` with a single `cat << EOF` block that documents usage, options, and a short description. Support both `-h` and `--help` (and accept `help` when it fits the command style).
- Parse options with `while`/`case` or a small `case "${1:-}" in ... esac` block, rejecting unknown flags with a helpful error message.
- For multi-action scripts, use a `main()` + `case` pattern used in, ending with `main "$@"`.
- Emit status updates with `print_heading`, `log_info`, `log_warn`, and `fail` instead of raw `echo`
- Call `require_command`, `require_file`, and `require_directory` before relying on external tools or resources.
- Reference paths relative to `REPO_ROOT` when interacting with repository files. Avoid `cd` unless absolutely required, and restore the working directory if you change it.

## Behavioural expectations

- Ensure every script provides a meaningful help message and graceful handling for already-correct state (idempotent operations).
- Guard destructive actions with backups or explicit confirmations.
- Prefer arrays and `[[ ... ]]` conditionals, consistent quoting, and descriptive function names.
- When adding new functionality, refresh the relevant docs: script help text, comments, files under `docs/`, and manifests such as Brewfiles so users arenâ€™t surprised.
- After creating or modifying scripts, run `./tests/run.sh`. If tests cannot be run, clearly report why in your response.

## Template snippet

Use this skeleton as a starting point for new scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
# shellcheck source=lib/bash/common.sh
source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/../../lib/bash/common.sh"

show_help() {
  cat << EOF
Usage: $(basename "$0") [OPTIONS]

Short description of what the script does.

OPTIONS:
  -h, --help    Show this help message and exit
EOF
}

main() {
  while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
    case $1 in
      -h|--help)
        show_help
        exit 0
        ;;
      *)
        echo "Unknown option: $1" >&2
        show_help
        exit 1
        ;;
    esac
  done

  print_heading "Do the thing"
  # script logic here
}

main "$@"
```

Stay consistent, keep scripts readable, and lean on the existing tooling helpers whenever possible.
